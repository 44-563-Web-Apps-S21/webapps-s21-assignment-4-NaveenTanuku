                His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
                overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
                her education promises; her dispositions she
                inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
                an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
                commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
                traitors too; in her they are the better for their
                simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
