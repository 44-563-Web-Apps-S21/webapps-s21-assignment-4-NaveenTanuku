        <h3>All's well that ends well</h3>
        <h4>Act 1, Scene 1: Rousillon. The COUNT's palace. - Play between three people which ends well</h4>
        <p class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</p>
        <p>
            <h8 class="name">COUNTESS</h8>  
            <p class="COUNTESS">In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</p>   
            <h8 class="name">BERTRAM</h8>
            <p class="BERTRAM"> And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
                anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
                whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. </p>
            <h8 class="name">LAFEU</h8>
            <p class="LAFEU"> You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
                sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
                good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
                worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
                than lack it where there is such abundance.</p>
            <h8 class="name">COUNTESS</h8>
            <p class="COUNTESS"> hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</p>
            <h8 class="name">LAFEU</h8>
            <p class="LAFEU">
                He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
            practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
            finds no other advantage in the process but only the
            losing of hope by time.
            </p>
            <h8 class="name">COUNTESS</h8> 
            <p class="COUNTESS">young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
                'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
                almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
                far, would have made nature immortal, and death
                should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
                king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
                the death of the king's disease.</p> 
            <h8 class="name">LAFEU</h8> 
            <p class="LAFEU">called you the man you speak of, madam?</p> 
            <h8 class="name">COUNTESS</h8> 
            <p class="COUNTESS">
                was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
            his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
            </p> 
            <h8 class="name">LAFEU</h8>
            <p class="LAFEU"> was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
                lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
                was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
                could be set up against mortality.</p>
            <h8 class="name">BERTRAM</h8>
            <p class="BERTRAM">What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</p>
